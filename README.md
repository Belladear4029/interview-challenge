# Feedr Frontend Challenge

Thank you for taking the time to attempt this challenge.

This app contains a static mock of an internal tool used to build sub-menus from a supplier's items.
Users should be able to select items from the left-hand sidebar, and have them appear in the Menu preview.

For this challenge, we would like you to:

- Populate items in the left-hand sidebar with data from `items.js`.
- Allow users to drag items from the left-hand sidebar, and drop them into the Menu Preview on the right hand side.
  (react-dnd is really useful, but alternatives are fine. If you get stuck, just clicking items in the sidebar will do)
- Be able to remove items from the menu by clicking the (x)
- Show the total number of selected items in the header
- Show the total number of each dietary type selected in the header
- Write unit tests (Enzyme and Jest are included, but feel free to use any framework you're comfortable with)

We do not want you to:

- Overstyle the application. Feel free to add niceties if you'd like, but please don't spend too much time on this.
- Change the build configuration of the project
- Worry about responsiveness

Using internal component state is fine, but you're welcome to use redux/context (or any other state library) if you wish.
Be prepared to justify your choice to (or not to) use a library.

We are looking for clean code, with sensible component structure and data propagation.

If you have any issues please email ash@teamfeedr.com

Good luck!
