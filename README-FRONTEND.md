# Frontend Challenge 

This app contains a static mock of an internal tool used to build sub-menus from a supplier's items.
Users should be able to select items from the left-hand sidebar and have them appear in the Menu preview.

## Part 1 - by yourself (~1hr)

For this challenge we would like you to:

- Populate items in the left-hand sidebar with data from `items.js`.
- Allow users to select items in the left-hand sidebar and have them appear in the Menu Preview on the right hand side.
- Be able to remove items from the menu by clicking the (x)
- Show the total number of selected items in the header
- Show the total number of each dietary type selected in the header

Please do any testing that you feel is necessary, and feel free to add additional notes in `README.md` outlining your thought process. Provide as much detail as you like (or none at all!). These will be used to create talking points during your interview.

We do not want you to:

- Overstyle the application. Please don't spend time writing a bunch of CSS.
- Worry too much about browser compatibility or responsiveness - this is an internal tool used only on desktops. 

We are looking for clean code with sensible component structure and data propagation. 

## Part 2 - pairing with a Feedr developer (~1hr)

We'll then take the code that you've already written and add a simple feature to extend it.


If you have any issues please email mark@feedr.co.

Good luck!
